Looking to straighten your teeth but unsure whether to choose **braces or clear aligners**? You're not alone. At **Nine Dental Centre, Mohan Garden, Delhi**, we help patients every day decide which orthodontic treatment best fits their needs.

In this guide, we’ll break down the differences, benefits, and key points of **braces vs aligners**, so you can make the right choice for your smile and lifestyle.

## **What Are Braces?**

Braces are time-tested orthodontic devices that use metal or ceramic brackets and wires to gradually move teeth into alignment. They are fixed to your teeth and adjusted regularly by the orthodontist.

### **Benefits of Braces:**

*   Work well for **complex dental issues**

*   No risk of forgetting to wear them

*   More affordable for many patients

*   Strong and effective in long-term treatments

## **What Are Clear Aligners?**

Clear aligners, often known as **invisible braces**, are custom-made plastic trays that fit over your teeth and are changed every 1–2 weeks. They’re transparent, removable, and becoming increasingly popular.

### **Benefits of Aligners:**

*   **Nearly invisible** – great for working professionals

*   **Removable** – eat what you like and maintain oral hygiene easily

*   Comfortable – no wires or poking brackets

*   Fewer dental visits in many cases

## **Braces or Aligners – Which Should You Choose?**

Choosing between braces and aligners depends on:

*   **Severity of your dental problem**

*   **Budget**

*   **Lifestyle and daily habits**

*   **Aesthetic preferences**

➡️ If your case is complicated or involves major bite correction, **braces** may be more suitable.

➡️ If you want a discreet, comfortable solution and can wear them responsibly, **aligners** are a great choice.

## ✅ **Smile Optimization Section (SOS) – FAQs**

### **2. How long does treatment take?**

Braces and aligners both take 12–24 months on average, depending on the complexity of your case.

### **3. Are aligners painful?**

They are generally more comfortable than braces but may cause slight pressure when changing trays.

### **4. Which is cheaper – braces or aligners?**

Traditional braces are usually more affordable. Clear aligners cost more but offer better aesthetics.
