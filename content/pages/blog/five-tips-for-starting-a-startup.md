## 🦷 What Are Dental Implants?

A **dental implant** is a titanium screw placed in the jawbone to replace the root of a missing tooth. It provides a strong foundation for a crown, bridge, or denture — restoring your smile permanently.

Unlike removable options, implants are **fixed**, durable, and blend seamlessly with your natural teeth.



## ✅ Who Can Get Dental Implants?

You may be a good candidate for dental implants if you:

*   Have one or more missing teeth

*   Want a permanent, natural-looking solution

*   Have healthy gums and sufficient jawbone

*   Are tired of loose dentures

*   Don’t want to trim natural teeth for a bridge

## 🛠️ How Is the Implant Procedure Done?

### At Nine Dental Centre, the process includes:

1.  **Consultation & X-ray/CBCT scan**

2.  **Implant placement** under local anesthesia

3.  **Healing period** (3–4 months) for bone integration
