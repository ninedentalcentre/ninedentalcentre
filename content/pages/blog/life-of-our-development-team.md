## **What Is Root Canal Treatment?**

Root Canal Treatment is a dental procedure used to treat infection or damage inside a tooth. It involves cleaning out the infected pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), disinfecting the root canals, and then sealing them to prevent further infection.

Contrary to popular belief, **RCT is not painful** ‚Äî it actually *relieves* pain caused by an infected tooth.



## **When Do You Need an RCT?**

You may need an RCT if you experience:

*   Persistent toothache

*   Sensitivity to hot or cold

*   Swelling near the gums

*   Deep decay or cracked tooth

*   Pain while chewing or biting

Ignoring these symptoms can lead to serious infections, abscesses, or even tooth loss.



## **How Is RCT Done at Nine Dental Centre?**

At Nine Dental Centre, we use **digital X-rays, rotary tools, apex locators, and advanced anesthesia** for a smooth and effective root canal.

### **RCT Process:**

1.  Diagnosis & digital X-ray

2.  Local anesthesia to numb the area

3.  Cleaning and shaping of the root canals

4.  Filling the canals with biocompatible material

In most cases, we offer **single-sitting RCT** unless the infection is severe.
