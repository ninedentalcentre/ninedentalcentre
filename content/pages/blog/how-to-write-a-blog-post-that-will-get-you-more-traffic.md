## 🧼 What Is Teeth Cleaning (Scaling & Polishing)?

Teeth cleaning, also known as **scaling and polishing**, is a routine dental procedure that removes **plaque, tartar, and stains** from your teeth and gums. It helps prevent **bad breath, gum disease, and tooth decay**.

### Benefits of professional cleaning:

*   Removes yellowish tartar buildup
