## 🧒 What Is Child Dentistry?

**Pediatric dentistry** focuses on the dental health of infants, children, and teenagers. Children have unique dental needs and require a gentle, understanding approach. From their first tooth to teenage braces, a pediatric dentist helps guide their oral development every step of the way.



## 🦷 Services We Offer for Children:

At Nine Dental Centre, we provide a complete range of child-friendly dental treatments:

*   **Teething & first dental check-ups**

## 😷 Why Is Dental Care Important for Children?
