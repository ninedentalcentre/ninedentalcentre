## 🦷 What Is Oral Surgery in Dentistry?

**Oral surgery** refers to specialized dental procedures that involve surgical treatment of the mouth, teeth, gums, and jaw. One of the most common oral surgeries is **wisdom tooth extraction**, especially when the tooth is impacted or causing pain.

### Common symptoms include:
